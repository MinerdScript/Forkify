# Forkify Project

Forkify consists on an application used to search and find recipes, in order to know how to cook them. Each recipe has an image, a description, ingredients, the number of servings for that amount of ingredients, the cooking time and a URl to direct the user to the recipe website. The application let you create your own recipes, showing the user each ones were made by him or not. Also theres a bookmark feature, making the user acess the bookmarks whenever he want. You can add more servings or remove, the ingredients will change in proportion.
I only did the javascript part, everything else were made by Jonas Schmedtmann. Special thanks to him by doing the course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" that teached me how to work with JavaScript and how the language itself works.

Features made by me in JS while doing the course:

1. Loading recipes from API
2. Rendering recipes
3. Searching Recipes
4. Pagination
5. Bookmarks system
6. Servings proportion
7. Adding recipe
8. Errors mensages to the UI
9. Storing bookmarks to the localStorage

Features made by me alone (used JS, scss and html):

1. Add more than 6 ingredients in add recipe tab
2. Button to delete all the bookmarks
3. Number of pages appearing on pagination
4. Ingredient validation
